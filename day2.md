# Introduction 
**Kernel**
 is a code/program that used to meet your Software and Hardware
# shell
Users communicate with the kernel by the # shell # it although called interpreter.
## types of shells
-SH
-BASH
-ZSH
-FISH
**based on their feature**
*they differ in colouring ,Piping,command compilation, some kind of features*
#What is OS- Operating system??
means the main software part of computer that helps to work on
**It contains:
○ Kernel
○ Softwares
○ Desktop environment
○ File extensions
○ Window manager**
*Note*:**Speed depends on:
	● Animations
	● High Graphics
	● Quality**
## *why linux is fast*
**Linux distributions are more efficiently developed**so it is most used
## *why linux is better for hacking*
**It is bootable from a USB, 
without installing it on the system.
There are Linux operating systems designed for the sole purpose of penetration testing and hacking.
It is free and open source.
Linux can run without GUI.
There is availability of hacking tools and scripts.**
## *why is Linux More Secure Than Windows?*
**-User Permissions
-Software Installation
-Open Source
-Updates
-Security through obscurity**
## **Linux distributions/distro**
● Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different
Example 
Debian
○ Kali linux
○ Ubuntu
○ Parrot
● Arch
○ Black 
arch
○ Garuda
● Fedora
● Red Hat
● Gentoo
● Android
# * **Kali linux** *
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for
digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained by Offensive Security.
Desktop Env: xfce
Package manager: apt
Shell: zsh
# * **Parrot Os** *
Parrot OS is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a focus on security, privacy, and development.
- Desktop Env: mate

** *n0te* ** windows doesn't have distro b/c the y are note open source 

**How can we use it?**
1) main boot
2) DualBoot / 2in1
3) Live boot
4) Cloud terminals
5) Virtual Machine
● Computers have a Technology called **“VIRTUALIZATION”**.
● This is a method to use windows and linux together.
● Softwares that gives you This ability:
○ HyberV
○ QEMU
○ Virtual Box - Oracle
○ VMware
6) WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux
7) Termux - Android
For running some codes And doing simple things!
